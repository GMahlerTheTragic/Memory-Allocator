# Simple Heap Memory Allocator using Buddy System

This project is a simple heap memory allocator implemented using the buddy system algorithm. The allocator is written in C and provides functionality to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory blocks.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `memory.c` and `memory.h`: These files contain the implementation and interface of the heap memory allocator.

- `main.c`: This file contains a sample program that demonstrates the usage of the memory allocator.

- `bitset.c` and `bitset.h`: These file contain the implementation of a simple bitset used in the allocator.

- `Makefile`: This file contains the build instructions using the `make` utility.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is required to compile the C code.

- GNU Make: The `make` utility is used to build and run the program.

## Building and Running the Program

To build and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Run the following command to build the program using `make`:

   ```shell
   make all
   ```
